# RPG 
An RPG game powered by React.



## Installation Instructions 

### After cloning down:
  - Run yarn install in both the root AND client directories 
  - DO NOT run yarn init in either directory - this will break the create-react-app boilerplate
  - When ready to run/test, use `yarn dev` when in the ROOT folder - this will concurrently run both the server and the react server (ports 3001, and 3000 respectively).
  



* Run `yarn dev` to start both the react server and the express server concurrently.

* The react front end operates on port 3000, the back end express server on 3001.
